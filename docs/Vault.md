# `Vault`

  The vault for holding ETH/tokens and deploying contracts
          for fetching individual deposits




## `validSig(struct IShared.SigData sigData, bytes32 contractMsgHash, enum IShared.KeyID keyID)`



   Calls isValidSig in _keyManager


## `constructor(contract IKeyManager keyManager)` (public)

## `transfer(struct IShared.SigData sigData, address tokenAddr, address payable recipient, uint256 amount)` (external)

 Transfers ETH or a token from this vault to a recipient


- `sigData`:   The keccak256 hash over the msg (uint) (here that's
                 a hash over the calldata to the function with an empty sigData) and 
                 sig over that hash (uint) from the aggregate key

- `tokenAddr`: The address of the token to be transferred

- `recipient`: The address of the recipient of the transfer

- `amount`:    The amount to transfer, in wei (uint)


## `transferBatch(struct IShared.SigData sigData, address[] tokenAddrs, address payable[] recipients, uint256[] amounts)` (external)

 Transfers ETH or tokens from this vault to a recipients. It is assumed
         that the elements of each array match in terms of ordering, i.e. a given
         transfer should should have the same index tokenAddrs[i], recipients[i],
         and amounts[i].


- `sigData`:   The keccak256 hash over the msg (uint) (here that's
                 a hash over the calldata to the function with an empty sigData) and 
                 sig over that hash (uint) from the aggregate key

- `tokenAddrs`: The addresses of the tokens to be transferred

- `recipients`: The address of the recipient of the transfer

- `amounts`:    The amount to transfer, in wei (uint)


## `fetchDepositEth(struct IShared.SigData sigData, bytes32 swapID)` (external)

 Retrieves ETH from an address, deterministically generated using
         create2, by creating a contract for that address, sending it to this vault, and
         then destroying


- `sigData`:   The keccak256 hash over the msg (uint) (here that's normally
                 a hash over the calldata to the function with an empty sigData) and 
                 sig over that hash (uint) from the aggregate key

- `swapID`:    The unique identifier for this swap (bytes32)


## `fetchDepositEthBatch(struct IShared.SigData sigData, bytes32[] swapIDs)` (external)

 Retrieves ETH from multiple addresses, deterministically generated using
         create2, by creating a contract for that address, sending it to this vault, and
         then destroying


- `sigData`:   The keccak256 hash over the msg (uint) (here that's normally
                 a hash over the calldata to the function with an empty sigData) and 
                 sig over that hash (uint) from the aggregate key

- `swapIDs`:    The unique identifiers for this swap (bytes32)


## `fetchDepositToken(struct IShared.SigData sigData, bytes32 swapID, address tokenAddr)` (external)

 Retrieves a token from an address deterministically generated using
         create2 by creating a contract for that address, sending it to this vault, and
         then destroying


- `sigData`:   The keccak256 hash over the msg (uint) (here that's normally
                 a hash over the calldata to the function with an empty sigData) and 
                 sig over that hash (uint) from the aggregate key

- `swapID`:    The unique identifier for this swap (bytes32), used for create2

- `tokenAddr`: The address of the token to be transferred


## `fetchDepositTokenBatch(struct IShared.SigData sigData, bytes32[] swapIDs, address[] tokenAddrs)` (external)

 Retrieves tokens from multiple addresses, deterministically generated using
         create2, by creating a contract for that address, sending it to this vault, and
         then destroying


- `sigData`:   The keccak256 hash over the msg (uint) (here that's normally
                 a hash over the calldata to the function with an empty sigData) and 
                 sig over that hash (uint) from the aggregate key

- `swapIDs`:       The unique identifiers for this swap (bytes32), used for create2

- `tokenAddrs`:    The addresses of the tokens to be transferred


## `getKeyManager() â†’ contract IKeyManager` (external)

 Get the KeyManager address/interface that's used to validate sigs


Returns

- The KeyManager (IKeyManager)

## `receive()` (external)
